(Reuters) - Democratic presidential contenders Bernie Sanders and Hillary Clinton sparred in a debate on Sunday over who had the best chance to beat Republican front-runner Donald Trump, and mocked the level of discourse in the Republican White House race. Near the end of a Michigan debate that featured sharp clashes over trade and the auto industry bailout, as well as a lengthy discussion of religion, Clinton and Sanders both said they could not wait to face the brash billionaire in the Nov. 8 election to succeed Democratic President Barack Obama. \\u201cI think Donald Trump\\u2019s bigotry, his bullying, his bluster, are not going to wear well on the American people,\\u201d Clinton said. \\u201cWe have to end the divisiveness, we have to unify the country.\\u201d Sanders said he would \\u201clove\\u201d to run against Trump and noted many opinion polls showed him faring better against him than Clinton did. He and Clinton urged voters to compare the substance of their debate with the Republican versions, which last week featured name-calling and Trump defending his penis size. \\u201cWe are, if elected president, going to invest a lot of money in mental health,\\u201d Sanders said, then cracked a joke. \\u201cAnd when you watch these Republican debates, you know why we need to invest in mental health.\\u201d Trump frequently says he will beat either Clinton or Sanders. \\u201cI am the one person that she does not want to run against,\\u201d he said of Clinton on Saturday.  The debate in Flint, which is suffering a water contamination and public health crisis, came as Sanders has struggled to slow Clinton\\u2019s march to the presidential nomination. Sanders picked up some good news on Sunday with a projected win in Maine\\u2019s caucus. Clinton, 68, a former secretary of state and first lady,  has spoken on the campaign trail of the need for more love and kindness, a contrast to Trump\\u2019s rhetoric about his plans to deport illegal immigrants and temporarily bar Muslims from entering the country. \\u201cI don\\u2019t intend to get into the gutter with whoever they nominate, but instead to lift our sights,\\u201d Clinton said in the debate. Describing herself as a \\u201cpraying person,\\u201d she said it was hard to imagine living under the pressure of the White House \\u201cwithout being able to fall back on prayer and on my faith.\\u201d Sanders, asked if he was deliberately keeping his Jewish faith in the background on the campaign trail, said his father\\u2019s family was wiped out in the Holocaust. He described going shopping with his mother as a boy in Brooklyn, New York, and seeing people with numbers on their arms from Nazi concentration camps. \\u201cI am very proud of being Jewish, and that is an essential part of who I am as a human being,\\u201d Sanders said. Earlier, the two candidates exchanged angry jabs over trade, with Sanders accusing Clinton of backing \\u201cdisastrous\\u201d trade policies that moved manufacturing jobs out of cities like Flint and Detroit and shifted them overseas. But Clinton said Sanders\\u2019 opposition to the 2009 auto bailout, a crucial issue in a state that is home to the U.S. auto industry, would have cost millions of jobs. The bailout, which Clinton supported, passed Congress and has been credited with helping save the U.S. industry. Sanders, 74 a U.S. senator from Vermont and democratic socialist, also questioned the sincerity of Clinton\\u2019s conversion to opposing the Trans-Pacific Partnership, a proposed 12-nation Pacific Rim trade deal. The two contenders cut each other off on several occasions, a rare occurrence in a race that has been much more polite than the raucous Republican presidential campaign. \\u201cExcuse me, I\\u2019m talking,\\u201d Sanders said to Clinton when she tried to interrupt. \\u201cIf you\\u2019re going to talk, tell the whole story,\\u201d Clinton responded. Sanders pressed his charge that Clinton was too close to Wall Street and demanded again that she release the transcript of paid speeches she has given to Wall Street firms. Clinton said she would release them when all the candidates, including Republicans, also release transcripts of similar talks. Throwing up his hands, Sanders said: \\u201cI\\u2019ll release it. Here it is. There ain\\u2019t nothing! I don\\u2019t give speeches to Wall Street!\\u201d The debate was held in Flint to highlight the city\\u2019s water contamination crisis, and both candidates expressed outrage at Flint\\u2019s plight and demanded Republican Governor Rick Snyder\\u2019s resignation. The crisis in Flint, a predominantly black city of 100,000, was triggered when an emergency city manager installed by Snyder switched the city\\u2019s water supply to the nearby Flint River from Lake Michigan to save money. The change corroded Flint\\u2019s aging pipes and released lead and other toxins into the water supply, exposing thousands of residents including children to high lead levels that have sparked serious health problems.

Why do you believe Juanita Broaddrick and not these two women,  Cooper asked, leaving a dumbfounded Lord to claim that the media isn t giving Clinton s accusers an  equal forum. But Clinton s accusers have no bearing on this election because Bill Clinton is not running for president, as other panelists reminded Lord. Furthermore, Bill Clinton was never charged with committing any crimes. Juanita Broaddrick filed a sworn affidavit stating that the rape allegations against Clinton are untrue. And these accusations against Clinton are 20 years old and have received a ton of media coverage over the years, especially during Clinton s presidency. The allegations against Trump, meanwhile, are new and haven t received near as much coverage.But Lord whined that the New York Times hasn t interviewed Broaddrick and then brought up a ridiculous anecdotal claim about meeting a couple from Virginia who supposedly think the media the treating Trump unfairly.When it became clear that Lord and Trump s other surrogates were not going to win this fight they resorted to calling Hillary Clinton an  enabler  of Bill Clinton behavior who supposedly bullied the women accusing Bill of sexual misconduct.But the other panelists would have none of it and proceeded to smack them down.Here s the video via YouTube:[ad3media campaign= 1136 ]The accusations against Bill Clinton have nothing to do with this election. Hillary Clinton is running for president, not her husband. Trump, on the other hand, IS running for president and the allegations against him are new and should be covered by the media.Donald Trump is unfit to be president and the fact that his supporters have to resort to bringing up Bill Clinton and his accusers in a lame effort to distract from that proves it.Featured Image: Screenshot\",\n          \"BEIJING (Reuters) - China\\u2019s Foreign Ministry said on Tuesday it hoped the United States would not allow transit by Taiwan President Tsai Ing-wen when she visits Guatemala next month.
